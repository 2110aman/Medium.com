          Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share
          insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the
          world—without building a mailing list or a following first. The
          internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight.
          It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right
          audience for whatever you have to say.

          We believe that what you read and write matters. Words can divide or
          empower us, inspire or discourage us. In a world where the most
          sensational and surface-level stories often win, we’re building a
          system that rewards depth, nuance, and time well spent. A space for
          thoughtful conversation more than drive-by takes, and substance over
          packaging.

              Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of
              the world through the power of writing.</mark

          Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every
          month. Many are professional writers, but just as many
          aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur
          novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into
          the world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping
          them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned
          that the rest of us might want to know too.
